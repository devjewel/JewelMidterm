Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?

-> A. Programming language is a formula language, which comprises a set of instructions used to produce
    various kind of out put.

What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
-> A. 1. The run time Interpeter. The defination of an interpeter is a person of a computer programer
    that people who speak different languages can cmmunicate.
    2. The applet viewer. Applet viewer is stand alone command line program from Sun to run Java
    applet.
    3. Debugger. Debugger the eclipse IDE java developer.



WWhat is IDEA?
-> A.Idea is a Java intregrated development environment(IDE) for developing computer software.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
-> 1.Eclipse 2. Android Studio 3.BlueJ 4. jEdit 5. jGRASP.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
what is class?
-> A class, in the context of Java, are templates that are used to create objects.
What is object?
-> A Object is a combination of data and procedures working on the available data.

What is the entry point of an application?
-> The main method is the entry point of a Java application,
it will look for the main method with Object is a super class of any class by default.the signature of public static void main(String[]) .

Why main is static?
-> we use static sometime for user defined methods so that we need not to make objects.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
-> Object is a super class of any class by default.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
-> Path is an environment variable and Classpath is an environment variable
 which is used by the Java compiler to find the path.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
-> Main difference is methods of a Java interface are implicitly abstract and cannot have implementations.
A Java abstract class can have instance methods that implements a default behavior.


Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
-> No,There are two ways you can achieve this. 1) Either you extend / implement the
Abstract class / interface in a new class, create the object of this new class and
then use this object as per your need. 2) The Compiler allows you to create
anonymous objects of the interfaces in your code.

what is Access Specifier?
-> Access specifiers for classes or interfaces in Java.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
-> OOP concepts in Java are the main ideas behind Java's Object Oriented Programming.
OOP Define:
 1.Encapsulation of data (getters and setters)
 2.Class data
 3.Inheritance

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
-> If you omit the package statement while writing the class definition, the class name
 is placed into the default package, which has no name. Java compiler
 automatically imports this package. Second, the java.lang package is imported implicitly.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
-> Java application programming interface (API)

tancDoes java support multiple inherie, explain why or why not?

What is method overloading and when it happens?
-> Method Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method
 the same name, if their argument lists are different. It is similar to
 constructor overloading in Java, that allows a class to have more than one
 constructor having different argument lists.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
-> an exception occurs within the try block, it is thrown. Your code can catch this exception (using
 catch block) and handle it in some rational manner. System-generated exceptions are automatically
 thrown by the Java run-time system. To manually throw an exception, use the keyword throw.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
-> The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly.These are class variables. They are variables declared outside of any methods, but within the class
 and as such exist for all methods in the class. ... Since x exists within the entire class, both methods
 can make use of it.


What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
- final keyword in a method declaration to indicate that the method cannot be overridden by subclasses.
- final is a non-access modifier applicable only to a variable, a method or a class.

What is final, finally and finalize?
-final keyword is used in different contexts. First of all, final is a non-access modifier.
-Java finally  is a block that is used to execute important code such as closing connection.
-finalize is called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection
 determines that there are no more references to the object.

What is a constructor ?
-A constructor in Java is a block of code similar to a method that's
 called when an instance of an object is created.



Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
-A class can have multiple constructors,
 as long as their signature (the parameters they take) are not the same.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
-If a class does not explicitly declare any, the Java compiler automatically
 provides a no-argument constructor, called the default constructor.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
-'THIS' Keyword is a reference variable in Java that refers to the current object.


What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
-It is used inside a sub-class method definition to call a method defined in the super class.
 Private methods of the super-class cannot be called.
 Only public and protected methods can be called by the super keyword.

What is JVM stand for ?
-Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Is JVM platform independent?
-> No,JVMs are not platform independent.

What version of java are you using?
-> In terminal(java - version).

What is JAR stand for ?
-> A JAR (Java ARchive) is a package file format typically used to aggregate many Java
 class files and associated metadata and resources (text, images, etc.)
 into one file for distribution.

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
-JDK is Java Developer Kit, the JDK is what you need to compile Java source code. and,
-JVM is Java Virtual Machine, the JVM actually runs Java bytecode.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
-JVM uses at runtime. and,
-JRE is an acronym for Java Runtime Environment.It is used to provide runtime environment.

What is compile time and run time?
-Compile process is referred to as compile time. and,
-A compiled program can be opened and run by a user.
 When an application is running, it is called runtime.

What is heap?
-> The Java virtual machine has a heap that is shared among all Java virtual machine threads.
 The heap is the runtime data area from which memory for all
 class instances and arrays is allocated.

How java manage it's memory?
-> The JVM loads the code, verifies the code, executes the code, manages
 memory (this includes allocating memory from the Operating System (OS), managing
 Java allocation including heap compaction and removal of garbage objects)
 and finally provides the runtime environment.


What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
-> Once a String object is created it cannot be changed -StringBuffer is mutable
 means one can change the value of the object . -StringBuilder allows manipulating
 character sequences by appending, deleting and inserting characters and strings.  

What is Singleton class?
-> Singleton class is to control object creation by keeping private constructor.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
-> Serialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which
 can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. and,
 The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization.

when to use transient variable in java?
-> A transient variable is a variable that may not be serialized. You use the transient
 keyword to indicate to the Java virtual machine that the indicated variable is not
 part of the persistent state of the object.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
-> Only difference between these two loops is that, in while loops, test expression is
 checked at first but, in do...while loop code is executed at first then the condition
 is checked. So, the code are executed at least once in do...while loops.

What is Enum?
-> Java Enum is a special Java type used to define collections of constants. More precisely,
 a Java enum type is a special kind of Java class. An enum can contain constants,
 methods etc. Java enums were added in Java 5.

What is Iterator?
-> An iterator over a Collection. Iterator takes the place of Enumeration in the Java
 collections framework. Iterators differ from Enumerations in two ways: Iterators allow
 the caller to remove elements from the underlying collection during the iteration
 with well-defined semantics.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
-> In that case, int , is 2 bytes. However, implementations are free to go beyond that
 minimum, as you will see that many modern compilers make int 32-bit (which also means 4 bytes
 pretty ubiquitously).

Why is String Immutable in Java?
-> Were String not immutable, a connection or file would be changed and lead to serious
 security threat. Mutable strings could cause security problem in Reflection too, as the
 parameters are strings. Efficiency The hashcode of string is frequently used in Java.
 For example, in a HashMap.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
-> Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor
 with respect to current object. Constructor chaining can be done in two ways: Within same
 class: It can be done using this() keyword for constructors in same class.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
-> Serial Collector is mostly designed for single-threaded environments. -Parallel Garbege
 Collector is used for multi-threaded environments 

What is JIT stands for?
-> Just In Time.

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
-> Garbage Collection. Garbage collection is the process of freeing space in the heap or
 the nursery for allocation of new objects. This section describes the garbage
 collection in the JRockit JVM.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
-> No.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
-> Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the
 JVM starts up and may increase or decrease in size while the application runs. -Garbage
 collection is the process of looking at heap memory, identifying which objects are in
 use and which are not, and deleting the unused objects. 

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
-> Reflection is an API which is used to examine or modify the behavior ofmethods, classes,
 interfaces at runtime.The required classes for reflection are provided under java.lang.
 reflect package.


what is multithreading in java?
-> Multithreading in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
 Thread is basically a lightweight sub-process, a smallest unit of processing.
 Multiprocessing and multithreading, both are used to achieve multitasking.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
-> So there is a need to synchronize the action of multiple threads and make sure that
 only one thread can access the resource at a given point in time. This is implemented using
 a concept called monitors. Each object in Java is associated
 with a monitor, which a thread can lock or unlock.

What is Framework?
-> While frameworks generally refer to broad software development platforms, the term can
 also be used to describe a specific framework within a larger programming environment.
 For example, multiple Java frameworks, such as Spring, ZK, and the Java Collections
 Framework (JCF) can be used to create Java programs

What are the testing Framework available in java?
-> The Java testing framework is very simple to use, and provides annotations for test method
 identi fications. ... Although JUnit is a popular unit testing framework,
 it can also be used for integration and acceptance tests.

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
-> Major difference in TestNG and JUnit test frameworks is their scope. I suggest to use
 TestNG as core unit test framework for Java project, because TestNG is more advance in
 parameterize testing, dependency testing and suite testing (Grouping concept). TestNG is
 meant for high-level testing and complex integration test.

What are the dependencies for this project?
-> Dependencies are the relationships of the preceding tasks to the succeeding tasks.
 Tasks may have multiple preceding tasks and multiple succeeding tasks.
 The most common dependency relationship is a finish-to-start relationship. ... Project
 Insight, project management software, supports all four dependency relationships.

what is dependency injection in java?
-> framework class, usually called the dependency container, could analyze the dependencies
 of this class. With this analysis it is able to create an instance of the class and inject
 the objects into the defined dependencies, via Java reflection. ... If dependency injection
 is used, a Java class can be tested in isolation.

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
-> Static binding in Java occurs during compile time while dynamic binding occurs during runtime.
 private , final and static methods and variables use static binding and are bonded by
 compiler while virtual methods are bonded during runtime based upon runtime object.
